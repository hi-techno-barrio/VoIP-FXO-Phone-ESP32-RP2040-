The program runs on an ESP32 board and is connected to a WiFi network for communication with a web server and an IAX2 server. The ESP32 board also performs audio 
processing using an ADC and DAC for input and output, respectively. The program has a call button that triggers a phone call using the IAX2 protocol. The program 
can also enable call forwarding to a specified phone number. The web server allows the user to configure network settings. Finally, the program also uses an LCD 
display for caller ID and call time

The program has the following features:

Connects to a WiFi network using the provided SSID and password.
Initializes the ADC and DAC pins for audio input and output.
Applies a digital filter to remove noise from the audio input.
Reads audio samples from the ADC and outputs them to the PAM4803 amplifier.
Connects to an IAX2 server using the provided user credentials.
Handles incoming and outgoing calls using the IAX2 protocol.
Displays the caller ID and call duration on an LCD display.
Provides a web interface for configuring network settings.
Enables call forwarding to a specified number when an incoming call is received and call forwarding is enabled.
Allows the user to place outgoing calls using a call button connected to a GPIO pin

Additional: 
Digital filters are used to process digital signals, which are discrete-time signals represented as sequences of numbers. They can be used to remove noise or 
unwanted frequencies from a signal, or to enhance certain features of a signal.
In the code provided, a digital filter is applied to an audio sample to remove noise before it is output to a PAM4803 amplifier. This helps to improve the quality
of the audio output.


This is a piece of code that defines classes and methods for audio processing and audio compression. The code defines four classes that inherit from a common abstract 
class Codec:

uLawCodec - implements the u-law compression algorithm
aLawCodec - implements the a-law compression algorithm
G711Codec - implements the G.711 compression algorithm
uLawG711Codec - implements u-law followed by G.711 compression
Each codec has a compress method and a decompress method that take in input audio data and output compressed audio data and vice versa. The Codec class defines some 
common methods that all codecs have, such as getName, getSampleRate, getBitsPerSample, and getBlockSize.

The code also defines three audio processing methods:

filter - implements a simple low-pass filter
amplify - amplifies the audio data by a given gain
reduceNoise - removes negative values from audio data
The filter method takes in an input audio signal and outputs a filtered version of it. It implements a simple low-pass filter that smoothes the signal. The amplify
method takes in an input audio signal and outputs a version of it that is amplified by a given gain. The reduceNoise method takes in an input audio signal and outputs
a version of it where negative values have been removed.

Overall, the code provides a simple framework for audio processing and compression. It could be extended to include other codecs and processing algorithms, and it 
could be used as a starting point for building more complex audio applications.
