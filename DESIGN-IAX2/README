The program runs on an ESP32 board and is connected to a WiFi network for communication with a web server and an IAX2 server. The ESP32 board also performs audio processing using an ADC and DAC for input and output, respectively. The program has a call button that triggers a phone call using the IAX2 protocol. The program can also enable call forwarding to a specified phone number. The web server allows the user to configure network settings. Finally, the program also uses an LCD display for caller ID and call time

The program has the following features:

Connects to a WiFi network using the provided SSID and password.
Initializes the ADC and DAC pins for audio input and output.
Applies a digital filter to remove noise from the audio input.
Reads audio samples from the ADC and outputs them to the PAM4803 amplifier.
Connects to an IAX2 server using the provided user credentials.
Handles incoming and outgoing calls using the IAX2 protocol.
Displays the caller ID and call duration on an LCD display.
Provides a web interface for configuring network settings.
Enables call forwarding to a specified number when an incoming call is received and call forwarding is enabled.
Allows the user to place outgoing calls using a call button connected to a GPIO pin

Additional: 
Digital filters are used to process digital signals, which are discrete-time signals represented as sequences of numbers. They can be used to remove noise or 
unwanted frequencies from a signal, or to enhance certain features of a signal.
In the code provided, a digital filter is applied to an audio sample to remove noise before it is output to a PAM4803 amplifier. This helps to improve the quality
of the audio output.
