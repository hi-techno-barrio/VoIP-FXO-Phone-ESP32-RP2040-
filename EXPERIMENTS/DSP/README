Defines constants for the maximum analog input value, the bit depth, the exponent bias, the number of mantissa bits, and the uLaw and aLaw compound tables.
Declares functions to compress an analog sample into uLaw and aLaw codecs using the defined constants and tables.
Sets up the serial communication to print the output.
In the main loop:
Reads the analog input from pin A0.
Calls the uLaw and aLaw compression functions on the analog sample.
Prints the original and compressed values to the serial monitor.
Delays for 100 milliseconds before looping again.
